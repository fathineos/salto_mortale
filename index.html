    <div class="container" style="font-family:duality-regular;">
        The Salto Mortale Puppet Theatre was founded in Athens. Their members have different backgrounds and work on puppetry as a way to express themselves.
        They are involved in all stages of the production, from the conceptualisation to the materialisation.
        They like to travel and perform on the street, theaters and bars as well as interact with artists from different cultural backgrounds.
        They discovered the world of puppet theatre in AYUSAYA Puppet Theatre (Stathis Markopoulos) and they are members of the Greek branch of UNIMA.

        A story about balance
        A story about life & death
        A story about a clown's imaginary world

        The performance presents the two different faces of a clown; his natural existence on stage and his existence when the lights go out.
        The first one focuses on his connection to the audience and the fearless overcoming of death. The clown lives through the laughter of the audience and creates a connection of dependency on it.
         Through this connection his fears, desires and dreams grow. The same feelings follow him out of the stage where itâ€™s very likely for him to be one of us.

        The performance focuses on the idea of a clown, so the characters and objects used are minimal and abstract.
